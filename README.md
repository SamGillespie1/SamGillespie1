# Hello! :wave:

My name is Sam Gillespie. I am currently a third year student studying aerospace engineering at Iowa State University. I am interested in learning more about flight structures and analysis and testing techniques in the aerospace industry. I am currently working on learning Visual Basic .NET on my own in order to prepare myself for my internship this summer.
